                <h3 style="font-size: 24px;">Inception and Development of Bangalore Namma Metro</h3>
                <p>The idea of the Bangalore metro was conceptualized in the early 1980s, but it took several years to
                    come into existence. The
                    Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) played a significant role in developing and planning the metro
                    system. The first phase of
                    the project, known as “Reach 1,” was inaugurated in October 2011, and the metro network has been
                    expanding ever since. The
                    expansion and implementation of the project are currently managed by the Bengaluru Metro Rail
                    Corporation Limited (BMRCL). </p>
